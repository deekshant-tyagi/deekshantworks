# 🚀 Deploy DeekshantWorks to Netlify

This guide will help you deploy your React portfolio website to Netlify in just a few minutes.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Your project code (already ready!)
- A GitHub account (optional but recommended)
- A Netlify account (free)

## 🎯 Method 1: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it `deekshantworks` or any name you prefer
   - Make it public or private (your choice)
   - Don't initialize with README (since you already have files)

2. **Push your local code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # Initialize git (if not already done)
   git init
   
   # Add all files
   git add .
   
   # Commit your changes
   git commit -m "Initial commit - DeekshantWorks portfolio"
   
   # Add your GitHub repository as origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy on Netlify

1. **Go to Netlify:**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "Sign up" and sign up with your GitHub account

2. **Import your project:**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
   - Find your portfolio repository and click on it

3. **Configure deployment settings:**

- You can customize this URL in site settings

## 🎯 Method 2: Drag & Drop Deploy (Quick & Easy)

### Step 1: Build Your Project
```bash
# Build your project for production
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up
2. On your dashboard, look for the drag & drop area
3. Drag and drop your `dist` folder directly onto the deploy area
4. Wait for deployment to complete
5. 🎉 Your site is live instantly!

## 🎯 Method 3: Netlify CLI (For Developers)

### Step 1: Install Netlify CLI
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Netlify
```bash
netlify login
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
# Build your project first
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy

# For production deployment
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## 🌐 Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

### Step 1: Add Custom Domain
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Click "Domain settings"
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Enter your domain (e.g., `deekshantworks.com`)

### Step 2: Configure DNS
Add these DNS records at your domain provider:

**For root domain (deekshantworks.com):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
```

**For www subdomain:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
```

**Or use Netlify DNS (Recommended):**
1. In Domain settings, click "Set up Netlify DNS"
2. Update your domain's nameservers to Netlify's
3. Netlify will handle all DNS automatically

## ⚡ Automatic Deployments & Features

Once connected to GitHub, Netlify automatically:
- ✅ Deploys when you push to the main branch
- ✅ Creates preview deployments for pull requests
- ✅ Shows build logs and deployment status
- ✅ Provides form handling (if you add contact forms)
- ✅ Offers serverless functions
- ✅ Includes CDN and SSL certificates

## 🔧 Environment Variables (If Needed)

If you need to add environment variables:

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to "Site settings" → "Environment variables"
3. Click "Add variable" and add:
   - `VITE_API_URL` → `https://your-api.com`
   - `VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL` → `your-email@example.com`

## 📊 Analytics & Performance

Netlify provides built-in analytics:
1. Go to your site dashboard
2. Click on "Analytics" tab (may require upgrade)
3. View traffic, performance, and form submissions

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Create netlify.toml (Optional)
Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project root for advanced settings:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# Check for errors in the terminal
# Fix any TypeScript or linting errors
npm run lint
```

### Site Not Loading Correctly?
- Check if your build command is `npm run build`
- Ensure publish directory is set to `dist`
- Verify all your assets use relative paths
- Check the deploy log for errors

### Need to Redeploy?
**If connected to GitHub:**
```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio"
git push
# Netlify will automatically redeploy!
```

**If using drag & drop:**
- Build your project: `npm run build`
- Drag the new `dist` folder to Netlify
